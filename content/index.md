Welcome to my digital-garden, personal notes, wiki or braincells :)

I'm Mariana, I live in Brazil and I like to work with Software Development. At the moment I'm focused on [[front-end]] but I'm also interested in the [[back-end]] world. And one of my studies that I also like is about [[ux-ui]] , very essential to speed up some things.

Basically here I'm going to try to organize my studies and my ideas for myself. I think writing is a great method for memorizing and I will still be practicing English :p

Right now I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to make my notes in Quartz.
