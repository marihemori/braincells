## HTML

Creator(s): Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau.
When: 1989.

Html (HiperText Markup Languague) is a markup language (not programming language :p). 

It contains various "tags" that help us build a semantic interface. The more these tags make sense in our application, the better it will be for the page's SEO to work and also to guide those who need help to guide themselves (people with disabilities).
